### Challenge Better Rest
- [x] Replace each VStack in our form with a Section, where the text view is the title of the section. 
- [x] Replace the “Number of cups” stepper with a Picker showing the same range of values.
- [x] Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the “Calculate” button entirely.

### Challenge Word Scramble
- [x] Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
- [x] Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
- [x] Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the player’s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
