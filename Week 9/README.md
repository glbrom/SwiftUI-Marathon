### Challenge Instafilter
- [x] Try making the Slider and Change Filter buttons disabled if there is no image selected.
- [x] Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
- [x] Explore the range of available Core Image filters, and add any three of your choosing to the app.

### Challenge Bucket List
- [x] Allow the user to switch map modes, between the standard mode and hybrid.
- [x] Our app silently fails when errors occur during biometric authentication, so add code to show those errors in an alert.
- [x] Create another view model, this time for EditView. What you put in the view model is down to you, but I would recommend leaving dismiss and onSave in the view itself – the former uses the environment, which can only be read by the view, and the latter doesn’t really add anything when moved into the model.
