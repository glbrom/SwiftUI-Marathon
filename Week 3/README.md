### Challenge Guess the Flag
- [x] When you tap a flag, make it spin around 360 degrees on the Y axis.
- [x] Make the other two buttons fade out to 25% opacity.
- [x] Add a third effect of your choosing to the two flags the user didn’t choose – maybe make them scale down? Experiment!

### Challenge MathTime
- [x] The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an “Up to…” stepper, going from 2 to 12.
- [x] The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, or 20.
- [x] You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for.

### Challenge iExpense
- [x] Use the user’s preferred currency, rather than always using US dollars.
- [x] Modify the expense amounts in ContentView to contain some styling depending on their value – expenses under $10 should have one style, expenses under $100 another, and expenses over $100 a third style. What those styles are depend on you.
- [x] For a bigger challenge, try splitting the expenses list into two sections: one for personal expenses, and one for business expenses.

### Challenge Moonshot
- [x] Add the launch date to MissionView, below the mission badge.
- [x] Extract one or two pieces of view code into their own new SwiftUI views – the horizontal scroll view in MissionView is a great candidate.
- [x] For a tough challenge, add a toolbar item to ContentView that toggles between showing missions as a grid and as a list.
